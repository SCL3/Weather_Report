A shell code used to read a csv file, select the data, 
send it to a 'c' code to sort it depending of the value selected (code 'c' created by us),
the c code will create a new file and a gnu code will read it (code 'gnu' created by us).

To properly use this program, please use this command "bash main.sh -f [name of your file.csv] ..."
use "bash main.sh --help" if you need it.
and use "make clear" to remove all the .o files.
